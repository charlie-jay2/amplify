            Hello there, amplify community! I've got a bit of a different
            announcement tonight, I would just like to start it off by thanking
            you all from the bottom of my heart for being in this community,
            every single one of you counts. Myself & Finlay have both started up
            so much companies together which you may have all seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the end of us opening so much companies, we are now focusing
            fully on Amplify. We both have agreed we want this one to be the
            company of ours that succeeds. So help us that little bit by
            inviting literally anyone and everyone on your friends list. Now;
            I'm gonna get a bit nerdy here, statistically, if everyone invites
            1-2 people, we will double in discord members quick and fast. This
            is all we ask, invite anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would love for this community to grow and branch off of
            everywhere, by 2025, we want to be working with big names across the
            platform providing realistic events, so do your part and help us. We
            currently have something spooky in the plans for you all in 2 months
            time, keep your eyes peeled tonight on the server & announcements,
            more information is to follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, thank you all for being apart of this together and I cannot
            wait to see what the future holds for us all.
          </p>
